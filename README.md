# Decentralised Social Network
MashTag is a decentralised social networking service on the Ethereum Blockchain where users post and interact with messages using their wallet.Big tech has abused its power and lost the trust of community. Their policies and behavior have caused polarization to reach all-time highs across the globe.

#The Problems MashTag Solves

<h4>Free Speech & Censorship Resistance
A decentralised social network allows users more control.There is no central authority (person, server or company) that dictates on users and block their freedom.

  # Data Privacy & Security
  
  <h4>We rely on public-key cryptography based on Ethereum Blockchain for account security, rather than relying on a single organisation to protect user data. We don’t track users.
    
    #Economic Neutrality
    
    <h4>We want to to liberate users from invasive advertising and the risk to privacy it poses. In future we are going to launch our own coin $MTAG to keep operations running in safe and effective manner.
      
      #Digital Ownership
      
      <h4>MashTag stores a user's knowledge on-chain, so that the user becomes the owner of the content he creates, which means greater control and greater rewards
